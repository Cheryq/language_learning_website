# language_learning_website
This is a group assignment, and we implemented a crawler, front-end, and back-end to form a wonderful webpage to help beginners learn languages ​​from all over the world (including English, Arabic, Chinese, French, etc.).

And we visualize a world map so that you can find popular local languages at any time for jump learning.
